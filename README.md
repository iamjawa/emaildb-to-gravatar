# emaildb-to-gravatar
A PHP script that takes Email Addresses from a MySQL Database and saves their Gravatars as JPG's. This was initially created in order to
change a website from a Gravatar based avatar system to a manual upload system, and so to save time we needed the JPG's of the current
user's Gravatars which we could use for their accounts on the new system. However, with almost 1500 users, we needed a solution that was
simple and flexible. That's when this script was written.
